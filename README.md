## Takes from project
Learnings
1. Handling date and time in JavaScript
2. ⁠css grid
3. ⁠drag and drop in react

Most difficult part was to handle drag and drop along with the time, it was difficult to imagine how moving event on canvas will effect time

I would have implemented the time and coordinate calculation better and covered all the use cases around it.
